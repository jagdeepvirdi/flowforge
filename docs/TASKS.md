## Phase 6 — Production Hardening (P1)

### 6.1 Gunicorn Deployment Guide
- [x] Document `gunicorn --workers 4 --worker-class gevent` in RUNBOOK.md (§4a)
- [x] Explain why Celery is required when running multiple Gunicorn workers
- [x] Add Nginx reverse-proxy config example
- [x] Add systemd units for web, scheduler, and Celery worker (RUNBOOK.md §4a)

### 6.2 SQLAlchemy Pool Tuning
- [x] Document `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE`, `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE` in `.env.example`
- [x] Add pool settings to `create_app()` from env vars
- [x] Add PgBouncer note in RUNBOOK.md §9

### 6.3 Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
- [x] `GET /api/metrics` — plain-text Prometheus format (no extra dependency)
- [x] Metrics: `flowforge_runs_total{status}`, `flowforge_runs_active`, `flowforge_queue_depth`
- [x] Requires Bearer token auth; documented scrape config + Grafana PromQL in RUNBOOK.md §10

### 6.4 Flower Dashboard (Celery Monitoring)
- [x] `flower` service added to `docker-compose.yml` with `--profile monitoring` (opt-in)
- [x] `FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH` and `FLOWER_PORT` env vars in `.env.example`
- [x] Documented in RUNBOOK.md §11 (Docker Compose + bare-metal + monitoring guide)

### 6.5 Dependency Audit in CI
- [x] `pip-audit` already runs in GitHub Actions `test.yml` — fails on any CVE
- [x] `npm audit --audit-level=high` already runs in `frontend` job
- [x] All `requirements.txt` deps pinned to exact versions ✅

### 6.6 Reliability & Hardening (from Codebase Review)
- [x] **[ARCH-2] Persistent Scheduler Jobstore** — APScheduler already uses `SQLAlchemyJobStore` when `FLOWFORGE_DB_URL` is set; falls back to memory with a warning. Tests confirm both paths.
- [x] **[CODE-3] Drive API Failure Visibility** — `_handle_attachments` now wraps each upload in try/except; failures fall back to direct attachment and are surfaced in Run History step logs via `warnings_out`.
- [x] **[DB-1] Prevent Invisible History** — `PipelineRun.pipeline_id` already uses `ondelete=SET NULL` (nullable); deleting a pipeline preserves all run rows with their denormalized `pipeline_name`.
- [x] **[SEC-3] SQL Sandbox Protection** — `render_sql()` added to `context.py`; warns when secret pipeline variables appear in SQL templates. `_secret_var_keys` stored in context by runner. Used in `db_query` and `report` steps for query rendering.

---

## Phase 7 — Observability & Admin UI

### 7.3 Code Climate Badge (Optional)
- [ ] Set up Code Climate maintainability badge
- [ ] Add to README badge row if grade is A or B

---

## Phase 8 — Compliance Track (P2 — Regulated Environments)

*Required before FlowForge can be deployed in finance, healthcare, or SOC2-reviewed environments.*

### 8.1 Data Protection
- [ ] **Report file encryption at rest** — encrypt output files using `FLOWFORGE_SECRET_KEY`; decrypt transparently on download
- [ ] **Secrets scanning in CI** — add `detect-secrets` or `truffleHog` GitHub Action; block commits with credential patterns
- [ ] **GDPR data export** — `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/export` — all run history, pipeline config, and personal data for a user
- [ ] **GDPR data deletion** — `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}?purge=true` — anonymize run history, remove credentials, delete user record

### 8.2 Identity Hardening
- [ ] **MFA (TOTP)** — `pyotp`; QR code enrollment in Settings; per-user or globally enforced by admin; backup codes
- [ ] **SSO / OAuth2 login** — "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft" using existing MSAL; map to internal user records by email
- [ ] **IP allowlisting** — `FLOWFORGE_ALLOWED_IPS=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.0/24`; reject at `before_request` middleware

### 8.3 Compliance Documentation
- [ ] **Data flow diagram** — which data FlowForge touches (query results, report files, email addresses), where stored, where transmitted
- [ ] **SAML support** — `python3-saml` for Okta / Azure AD / Ping enterprise IdP *(v2.x, lower priority)*

- [ ] Mailgun email provider
- [ ] Telegram / Slack / Teams notification step

## Pipeline Features
- [ ] Pipeline dependencies — run pipeline B only after pipeline A succeeds
- [ ] Parallel step execution within a single pipeline
- [ ] Pipeline run diff view — row count and output size delta vs last run
- [ ] Report column formatting rules — number format, date format, conditional cell colours in Excel
- [ ] Environment promotion workflow — dev → staging → prod config sync

## Platform
- [ ] Plugin system — community step types loaded from a directory
- [ ] `ff_project_members` join table — team-scoped project access (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Password reset flow via email (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Distributed Redis-backed concurrency lock (replaces per-process semaphore for horizontal scale)

---

## Phase 9 — Automation Scenarios (SSH & Remote Execution)

### 9.1 Infrastructure Support
- [x] **Implement `SSHConnection`** — new connection type to store host, port, credentials (password/key_path)
- [x] **Implement `SshCommandStep`** — execute remote commands/scripts via paramiko; capture stdout/stderr
- [x] **Implement `DbHealthCheckStep`** — industry-standard metrics (Lag, Locks, Bloat, Sessions)
- [x] **Smart Alerting Logic** — add `send_only_on_failure` toggle to pipelines to suppress routine emails
- [x] **Alembic migration** — update `ck_step_type` to include `ssh_command`, `db_health_check`, and `data_report`
- [x] **Implement `ScriptReportStep`** — generate Excel/CSV/PDF from pipeline context variables (e.g. Shell script outputs)

### 9.2 Scenario 1: Industry-Standard Health Monitoring
- [x] **Configure Daily Health Pipeline** — importable YAML templates in `examples/` (daily digest + alerting variant)
- [x] **Standard SSH Metrics**: Load Average, Memory Usage (`free -m`), Disk I/O, and `df -h` — documented in `docs/scenarios/health-monitoring.md`
- [x] **Standard DB Metrics**: PostgreSQL (`pg_stat_activity`, cache hit ratio, replication lag) and Oracle (`v$session`, `v$sysstat`, tablespace usage) — implemented in `DbHealthCheckStep`
- [x] **Conditional Execution**: Threshold-check SSH step exits 1 on breach; `send_only_on_failure: true` suppresses routine emails — documented with example in alerting YAML template

### 9.3 Scenario 2: Remote Script & Log Processing
- [x] **Configure Log Extraction Pipeline** — importable YAML in `examples/log-extraction-pipeline.yaml` (SSH → Report → Email, 3 steps)
- [x] **Log Handling**: `ssh_command` gains `save_output: true` — writes stdout/stderr to a `.log` file and sets `output_path`; attach alongside Excel via `{{ steps.<name>.output_path }}`

## Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| ~~cx_Oracle requires Oracle Instant Client~~ | ✅ Migrated to `python-oracledb` (thin mode, pure Python) |
| M365 requires Azure AD app registration | Step-by-step guide in `docs/email-providers.md`; `flowforge setup microsoft365` wizard |
| Gmail OAuth2 token expiry | Refresh token handling; re-auth wizard in Settings |
| Drive folder ID opaque to users | Folder picker in frontend fetches Drive tree via API |
| Smart attachment: Drive upload fails after report generated | Fallback: attach directly if Drive upload fails, log warning |
| Large report query times out in Preview | Preview uses `LIMIT 20` wrapper around user query |
| Oracle LOB columns break row serialization | OracleConnection reads LOB values explicitly before cursor close |
| SonarCloud flags security hotspots | Review each hotspot; most will be acknowledged false positives with justification comments |
