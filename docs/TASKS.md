### Phase 3 — Backlog (v2+, no fixed date)

*These are real gaps but not blockers for initial open-source release.*

- [ ] Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift connectors
- [ ] AWS S3 / Azure Blob upload step
- [ ] MSSQL / SQL Server connection support
- [ ] Generic ODBC connection support
- [ ] SendGrid / AWS SES / Mailgun email providers
- [ ] Pipeline dependencies (run pipeline B only after pipeline A succeeds)
- [ ] Parallel step execution within a single pipeline
- [ ] Environment promotion workflow (dev → staging → prod pipeline config sync)
- [ ] Distributed concurrency control (Redis-backed advisory lock replacing in-process semaphore) — see v2 High-Concurrency Track
- [ ] Pipeline run diff view ("what changed since last run" for row counts / output sizes)
- [ ] Report column formatting rules (number format, date format, conditional cell colours in Excel)

## Multi-User Feature — Active Sprint

> Foundation already in place: `ff_users` + `role` column, `require_role` decorator, `ff_token_blocklist`, `ff_projects`. Cutting `ff_project_members` and password-reset (v3). Estimated: ~3 days backend + 1.5 days frontend.

### MU-1 — JWT carries `user_id` + `/api/auth/me` *(backend)* ✅
- [x] `auth.py:generate_token` — `uid: user.id` already in JWT payload ✅
- [x] `require_auth` — sets `g.current_user_id = payload.get('uid')` after token decode ✅
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me` — returns `{ id, username, role }` for the current token; 401 for legacy tokens without `uid` ✅
- [x] Tests: 3 new tests — `/api/auth/me` correct fields, requires auth, rejects legacy token without uid — all passing ✅

### MU-2 — User management API *(backend)* ✅
- [x] `POST /api/users` — create user: `{ username, password, role }` — admin only ✅
- [x] `GET /api/users` — list all users (id, username, role, created_at) — admin only ✅
- [x] `PATCH /api/users/{id}` — update role or username — admin only; cannot demote self ✅
- [x] `DELETE /api/users/{id}` — delete user — admin only; cannot delete self ✅
- [x] `POST /api/auth/change-password` — `{ current_password, new_password }` — any authenticated user; min 8 chars ✅
- [x] 22 tests covering auth, role checks, self-protection guards, duplicate username, password validation — all passing ✅

### MU-3 — `@require_role` guards on all remaining routes *(backend)* ✅
- [x] `pipelines.py` — create/update/delete/run/clone/import/webhook-tokens → `require_role(['admin','editor'])` ✅
- [x] `reports.py` — create/update/delete → `require_role(['admin','editor'])` ✅
- [x] `emails.py` — create/update/delete → `require_role(['admin','editor'])` ✅
- [x] `recipients.py` — create/update/delete → `require_role(['admin','editor'])` ✅
- [x] `runs.py` — added `POST /runs/<id>/cancel` → `require_role(['admin','editor'])`; 409 if not running ✅
- [x] `providers.py` — create/delete upgraded from `require_auth` → `require_role('admin')` ✅
- [x] `connections.py` — update upgraded from `require_auth` → `require_role('admin')` ✅
- [x] 21 RBAC spot-check tests in `tests/test_rbac.py` — viewer 403 on writes, 200 on reads; editor passes where expected — all 742 suite tests passing ✅

### MU-4 — Audit log user attribution *(backend)* — partially done ✅
- [x] `audit.py` — `_current_user()` reads `g.user_token['sub']` (username) and appends `by=<username>` to every log entry. All `audit.log_*` call sites covered. ✅
- [ ] When MU-1 adds `user_id` to the JWT payload, optionally also log `user_id=<uuid>` alongside the username for cross-referencing with `ff_users`

### MU-5 — Frontend role context *(frontend)* ✅
- [x] `lib/types.ts` — added `Role` type + `CurrentUser` interface ✅
- [x] `lib/api.ts` — `getMe()` calls `GET /api/auth/me` ✅
- [x] `lib/auth.ts` — `useAuth` store extended with `user: CurrentUser | null` + `setUser`; `clearToken` also clears `user` ✅
- [x] `useCurrentUser()` hook exported from `lib/auth.ts` — selector over store, no extra API calls ✅
- [x] `Login.tsx` — calls `getMe()` + `setUser()` immediately after token so role is available before navigation ✅
- [x] `App.tsx` — `AppBootstrap` component: `useEffect([token])` calls `getMe()` on every page load/refresh; clears token if call fails (expired token) ✅
- [x] Login test updated to mock `getMe` + `setUser`; all 24 frontend tests passing ✅

### MU-6 — User management UI *(frontend)* ✅
- [x] New page `src/pages/Users.tsx` — admin-only; redirect non-admins to dashboard ✅
- [x] Route `/settings/users` in `App.tsx`; admin-only nav item in `Layout.tsx` via `useCurrentUser()` ✅
- [x] Users table: username col with "(you)" badge, inline role select (disabled for self), delete button ✅
- [x] "Add User" modal: username + password + role selector → `POST /api/users` ✅
- [x] "Change Password" card in Settings page (self-service, any user) ✅
- [x] 24 frontend tests passing ✅

### MU-7 — Frontend role-based visibility *(frontend)* ✅
- [x] Connections — hide "Add Connection", "Edit", "Delete" for non-admins (`isAdmin = role === 'admin'`) ✅
- [x] Providers — same page as Connections; handled in same component ✅
- [x] Pipelines — hide "New Pipeline", Import, Run/Clone/Edit/Delete per-row for viewers ✅
- [x] Dashboard — hide "Run Now", "Edit" for viewers in PipelineCard; hide "New Pipeline" button ✅
- [x] Reports / Emails / Recipients — hide create/edit/delete for viewers ✅
- [x] All via `useCurrentUser().role` — no API calls, instant from Zustand store ✅
- [x] Connections test updated to mock `useCurrentUser` returning admin ✅
- [x] 24 frontend tests passing ✅

## After Multi-User Sprint

*These two items are ready to implement once MU-1 through MU-7 are done.*

### Celery Wiring — Complete the Task Queue Migration
- [ ] `flowforge/engine/launcher.py` — replace `threading.Thread` call with `run_pipeline_task.delay(pipeline_id, triggered_by, run_id)`
- [ ] Remove in-process `_semaphore` from `launcher.py` (Celery worker concurrency replaces it)
- [ ] Verify end-to-end: trigger a pipeline run via API, confirm Celery worker picks it up and writes run history
- [ ] (Optional) Add Flower dashboard service to `docker-compose.yml` for real-time task monitoring

### Audit Log `user_id` Attribution — MU-4 *(optional follow-up)*
- `audit.py` already logs `by=<username>` on every entry via `_current_user()` — username attribution is done ✅
- [ ] After MU-1 adds `user_id` to the JWT, optionally also emit `user_id=<uuid>` in audit entries for UUID-based cross-referencing with `ff_users`

---

## Critical Action Items (Post-Review May 2026)

### P0 — UX & Confidence
- [x] **Mobile/Responsive**: `@media` breakpoints (640px, 1024px, 1200px) added to `index.css`; responsive sidebar + card layout. Committed `9ff50ec`. ✅

### P1 — Technical Debt & Scalability
- [x] **Frontend Refactor**: Inline `style={{}}` replaced with Tailwind in `Dashboard.tsx`, `PipelineEdit.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`. ~12 dynamic computed values remain (bar colors, skeleton widths — acceptable). Committed `9ff50ec`. ✅
- [x] **Task Queue (v2) — Scaffolded**: `celery_app.py`, `tasks.py`, Redis service + worker service in `docker-compose.yml`, `celery[redis]` in `requirements.txt`. Committed `d6272d1`. ⚠️ `launcher.py` still uses `threading.Thread` — wiring Celery into the launcher is the remaining step (see v2 High-Concurrency Track).

### P1 — Security & Compliance
- [ ] **RBAC**: *(In progress — see Multi-User Sprint above)*
- [x] **Audit log user attribution** — `_current_user()` in `audit.py` logs `by=<username>` on every entry ✅ *(UUID follow-up after MU-1 — see After Multi-User Sprint)*

## v2 Track — Multi-User Support

*Required before FlowForge can be used by teams where more than one person logs in.*

### Auth & Identity
- [x] `ff_users` table — `role` column added (migration 0018) ✅
- [x] `require_role` decorator in `auth.py` ✅
- [x] `ff_token_blocklist` table for server-side revocation ✅
- [ ] JWT carries `user_id` — see MU-1
- [ ] User management API + UI — see MU-2 / MU-6
- [ ] `ff_project_members` join table — deferred to v3
- [ ] Password reset flow — deferred to v3

### Role-Based Access Control
- [x] `@require_role('admin')` on connections (create/delete) and providers ✅
- [ ] Guards on all remaining routes — see MU-3
- [ ] Frontend role visibility — see MU-5 / MU-7
- [ ] Audit log `user_id` — see MU-4

### Effort estimate: ~3 days backend + 1.5 days frontend (scoped, project-member access deferred)

---

## v2 Track — High-Concurrency Support

*Required before FlowForge can reliably handle 50+ simultaneous pipeline runs or horizontal scaling.*

### Task Queue (biggest change)
- [x] **`celery_app.py` + `tasks.py`** — `run_pipeline_task` Celery task defined; `celery[redis]` in requirements. Committed `d6272d1`. ✅
- [x] **Redis service + Celery worker in `docker-compose.yml`** — `redis:7-alpine` + `worker` service wired. Committed `d6272d1`. ✅
- [ ] **Wire `launcher.py` to Celery** — replace `threading.Thread` call in `launcher.launch_run` with `run_pipeline_task.delay(...)` and remove the in-process `_semaphore`
- [ ] **Flower dashboard** (optional but recommended) — `celery -A flowforge.celery_app flower`; real-time task monitoring

### Scheduler
- [x] **APScheduler PostgreSQL jobstore** — `SQLAlchemyJobStore` in `scheduler.py`; jobs survive restarts ✅
- [x] **Remove dead `_load_pipeline_jobs`** — replaced by `_sync_pipeline_jobs` + jobstore ✅

### API & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Gunicorn multi-worker deployment** — document `gunicorn -w 4 wsgi:app`; in-memory semaphore doesn't work across workers (resolved by Celery)
- [ ] **PgBouncer or SQLAlchemy pool tuning** — prevent DB connection exhaustion under load; document `pool_size`, `max_overflow` settings
- [ ] **Metrics endpoint** — `GET /api/metrics` returning Prometheus-compatible counters: runs queued, running, succeeded, failed; worker count; queue depth
- [x] **Graceful shutdown** — `flowforge/engine/shutdown.py`; `SIGTERM` handler + `atexit`; `TimeoutStopSec=90` in systemd units ✅

### Effort estimate: Celery migration alone ~1 week; rest is configuration (1–2 days)

---

## v2 Track — Regulated Environments (Compliance / SOC2 / GDPR)

*Required before FlowForge can be deployed in finance, healthcare, or any environment with a compliance review.*

### Audit & Logging
- [x] **Audit log completeness** — login, pipeline events, connection/provider config changes all logged ✅
- [x] **Structured audit stdout** — `FLOWFORGE_AUDIT_STDOUT=true` emits JSON lines via `_JsonStdoutHandler` ✅
- [x] **Log rotation** — `RotatingFileHandler` (10 MB × 5 backups) in `audit.py` ✅
- [x] **Username attribution in every audit entry** — `_current_user()` reads `g.user_token['sub']`; all call sites covered ✅ *(UUID cross-reference optional after MU-1)*
- [ ] **Audit log UI page** — admin-only view with filters (user, action type, date range)
- [ ] **Retention policies** — configurable auto-purge of `ff_pipeline_runs` / `ff_step_runs` / audit log after N days

### Identity & Access Hardening
- [ ] **MFA (TOTP)** — time-based one-time password via `pyotp`; QR code enrollment in Settings; enforced per-user or globally by admin
- [ ] **SSO / OAuth2 login** — "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft" using the MSAL library already installed; map to internal user records
- [ ] **SAML support** — `python3-saml` for enterprise IdP integration (Okta, Azure AD, Ping)
- [ ] **IP allowlisting** — global or per-project; `FLOWFORGE_ALLOWED_IPS` env var; reject requests outside the list at the API middleware level

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Report file encryption at rest** — encrypt output files on disk with the `FLOWFORGE_SECRET_KEY`; decrypt on download
- [ ] **Secrets scanning in CI** — add `detect-secrets` or `truffleHog` GitHub Action to prevent credential commits
- [x] **SAST in CI** — `bandit` (Python) + `npm audit` in GitHub Actions CI ✅
- [ ] **GDPR data export** — `GET /api/admin/export-user-data?user_id=...`
- [ ] **GDPR data deletion** — `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` — anonymize run history, remove credentials, delete user record

### Compliance Documentation
- [ ] **Security policy doc** — `docs/security.md`: credential encryption details, key rotation procedure, access control model, incident response contacts
- [ ] **Data flow diagram** — what data touches FlowForge (query results, report files, email addresses) and where it is stored/transmitted
- [ ] **Dependency audit** — `pip-audit` + `npm audit` in CI; fail build on critical CVEs

### Effort estimate: 3–4 weeks for the full list; audit log + RBAC + MFA covers 80% of most internal compliance reviews

## Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| ~~cx_Oracle requires Oracle Instant Client~~ | ✅ Resolved — migrated to `python-oracledb` (thin mode, pure Python, no Instant Client needed) |
| M365 requires Azure AD app registration | Step-by-step guide in docs/email-providers.md; flowforge setup microsoft365 wizard |
| Gmail OAuth2 token expiry | Refresh token handling; re-auth wizard in settings |
| Drive folder ID opaque to users | Folder picker in frontend fetches Drive tree via API |
| Smart attachment: Drive upload fails after report generated | Fallback: attach directly if Drive upload fails, log warning |
| Large report query times out in Preview | Preview uses `LIMIT 20` wrapper around user query |
| Oracle LOB columns break row serialization | OracleConnection reads LOB values explicitly before cursor close |
