- [ ] Pin all dependencies to exact versions in `requirements.txt` (currently pinned ✅ — verify)

### 6.6 Reliability & Hardening (from Codebase Review)
- [ ] **[ARCH-2] Persistent Scheduler Jobstore** — Move APScheduler from memory to PostgreSQL jobstore for durability and multi-process safety
- [ ] **[CODE-3] Drive API Failure Visibility** — Ensure "Smart Attachment" failures are visible in Run History logs (not just silent fallback)
- [ ] **[DB-1] Prevent Invisible History** — Prevent run history from "disappearing" from UI when a pipeline is deleted (Soft delete vs denormalization)
- [ ] **[SEC-3] SQL Sandbox Protection** — Prevent secret exfiltration via Jinja2 (Safe variable namespace for SQL rendering)

---

## Phase 7 — Observability & Admin UI

### 7.3 Code Climate Badge (Optional)
- [ ] Set up Code Climate maintainability badge
- [ ] Add to README badge row if grade is A or B

---

## Phase 8 — Compliance Track (P2 — Regulated Environments)

*Required before FlowForge can be deployed in finance, healthcare, or SOC2-reviewed environments.*

### 8.1 Data Protection
- [ ] **Report file encryption at rest** — encrypt output files using `FLOWFORGE_SECRET_KEY`; decrypt transparently on download
- [ ] **Secrets scanning in CI** — add `detect-secrets` or `truffleHog` GitHub Action; block commits with credential patterns
- [ ] **GDPR data export** — `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/export` — all run history, pipeline config, and personal data for a user
- [ ] **GDPR data deletion** — `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}?purge=true` — anonymize run history, remove credentials, delete user record

### 8.2 Identity Hardening
- [ ] **MFA (TOTP)** — `pyotp`; QR code enrollment in Settings; per-user or globally enforced by admin; backup codes
- [ ] **SSO / OAuth2 login** — "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft" using existing MSAL; map to internal user records by email
- [ ] **IP allowlisting** — `FLOWFORGE_ALLOWED_IPS=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.0/24`; reject at `before_request` middleware

### 8.3 Compliance Documentation
- [ ] **Data flow diagram** — which data FlowForge touches (query results, report files, email addresses), where stored, where transmitted
- [ ] **SAML support** — `python3-saml` for Okta / Azure AD / Ping enterprise IdP *(v2.x, lower priority)*

# V3.0 BACKLOG

*No fixed date. Community-driven. Good candidates for "good first issue" labeling.*

## New Connectors & Providers
- [ ] Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift connectors
- [ ] AWS S3 / Azure Blob upload step
- [ ] MSSQL / SQL Server connection support
- [ ] Generic ODBC connection support
- [ ] SendGrid API email provider
- [ ] AWS SES email provider
- [ ] Mailgun email provider
- [ ] Telegram / Slack / Teams notification step

## Pipeline Features
- [ ] Pipeline dependencies — run pipeline B only after pipeline A succeeds
- [ ] Parallel step execution within a single pipeline
- [ ] Pipeline run diff view — row count and output size delta vs last run
- [ ] Report column formatting rules — number format, date format, conditional cell colours in Excel
- [ ] Environment promotion workflow — dev → staging → prod config sync

## Platform
- [ ] Plugin system — community step types loaded from a directory
- [ ] `ff_project_members` join table — team-scoped project access (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Password reset flow via email (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Distributed Redis-backed concurrency lock (replaces per-process semaphore for horizontal scale)

---

## Phase 9 — Automation Scenarios (SSH & Remote Execution)

### 9.1 Infrastructure Support
- [ ] **Implement `SSHConnection`** — new connection type to store host, port, credentials (password/key_path)
- [ ] **Implement `SshCommandStep`** — execute remote commands/scripts via paramiko; capture stdout/stderr
- [ ] **Implement `DbHealthCheckStep`** — industry-standard metrics (Lag, Locks, Bloat, Sessions)
- [ ] **Smart Alerting Logic** — add `send_only_on_failure` toggle to pipelines to suppress routine emails
- [ ] **Alembic migration** — update `ck_step_type` to include `ssh_command`, `db_health_check`, and `data_report`
- [ ] **Implement `ScriptReportStep`** — generate Excel/CSV/PDF from pipeline context variables (e.g. Shell script outputs)

### 9.2 Scenario 1: Industry-Standard Health Monitoring
- [ ] **Configure Daily Health Pipeline** — 4 SSH steps + 2 DB Health steps + Data Report step + Email step
- [ ] **Standard SSH Metrics**: Load Average, Memory Usage (`free -m`), Disk I/O, and `df -h`.
- [ ] **Standard DB Metrics**:
    - **Oracle**: `v$instance`, `v$sysstat` (buffer cache hit ratio), `v$dataguard_stats`.
    - **Postgres**: `pg_stat_database` (cache hit ratio), `pg_stat_replication`, `pg_stat_activity`.
- [ ] **Conditional Execution**: Use FlowForge's `on_error: stop` and variable checks to only email if thresholds are exceeded (e.g., Disk > 90%).

### 9.3 Scenario 2: Remote Script & Log Processing
- [ ] **Configure Log Extraction Pipeline** — SSH step (run script) + existing `ReportStep` (query the updated table) + Email step
- [ ] **Log Handling**: Attach the stdout/stderr log from the SSH step directly to the email alongside the Excel.

## Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| ~~cx_Oracle requires Oracle Instant Client~~ | ✅ Migrated to `python-oracledb` (thin mode, pure Python) |
| M365 requires Azure AD app registration | Step-by-step guide in `docs/email-providers.md`; `flowforge setup microsoft365` wizard |
| Gmail OAuth2 token expiry | Refresh token handling; re-auth wizard in Settings |
| Drive folder ID opaque to users | Folder picker in frontend fetches Drive tree via API |
| Smart attachment: Drive upload fails after report generated | Fallback: attach directly if Drive upload fails, log warning |
| Large report query times out in Preview | Preview uses `LIMIT 20` wrapper around user query |
| Oracle LOB columns break row serialization | OracleConnection reads LOB values explicitly before cursor close |
| SonarCloud flags security hotspots | Review each hotspot; most will be acknowledged false positives with justification comments |
