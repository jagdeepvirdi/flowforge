---

## Phase 6 — Production Hardening (P1)

### 6.1 Gunicorn Deployment Guide
- [ ] Document `gunicorn -w 4 -k gevent flowforge.api.app:create_app()` in RUNBOOK.md
- [ ] Explain why Celery is required when running multiple Gunicorn workers
- [ ] Add Nginx reverse-proxy config example
- [ ] Add systemd unit for Gunicorn (alongside existing scheduler unit)

### 6.2 SQLAlchemy Pool Tuning
- [ ] Document `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE`, `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT` in `.env.example`
- [ ] Add pool settings to `create_app()` from env vars
- [ ] Add PgBouncer note for deployments with 100+ concurrent pipelines

### 6.3 Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
- [ ] `GET /api/metrics` — plain-text Prometheus format
- [ ] Counters: `flowforge_runs_total{status}`, `flowforge_runs_active`, `flowforge_queue_depth`
- [ ] Expose via `prometheus_client` library (add to requirements)
- [ ] Document scrape config for Grafana / Prometheus stack

### 6.4 Flower Dashboard (Celery Monitoring)
- [ ] Add `flower` service to `docker-compose.yml` (port 5555)
- [ ] Add `FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH` env var for basic auth protection
- [ ] Document in RUNBOOK.md

### 6.5 Dependency Audit in CI
- [ ] Add `pip-audit` step to GitHub Actions — fail on CRITICAL CVEs
- [ ] `npm audit --audit-level=high` already runs; confirm it fails the build correctly
- [ ] Pin all dependencies to exact versions in `requirements.txt` (currently pinned ✅ — verify)

---

## Phase 7 — Observability & Admin UI

### 7.3 Code Climate Badge (Optional)
- [ ] Set up Code Climate maintainability badge
- [ ] Add to README badge row if grade is A or B

---

## Phase 8 — Compliance Track (P2 — Regulated Environments)

*Required before FlowForge can be deployed in finance, healthcare, or SOC2-reviewed environments.*

### 8.1 Data Protection
- [ ] **Report file encryption at rest** — encrypt output files using `FLOWFORGE_SECRET_KEY`; decrypt transparently on download
- [ ] **Secrets scanning in CI** — add `detect-secrets` or `truffleHog` GitHub Action; block commits with credential patterns
- [ ] **GDPR data export** — `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/export` — all run history, pipeline config, and personal data for a user
- [ ] **GDPR data deletion** — `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}?purge=true` — anonymize run history, remove credentials, delete user record

### 8.2 Identity Hardening
- [ ] **MFA (TOTP)** — `pyotp`; QR code enrollment in Settings; per-user or globally enforced by admin; backup codes
- [ ] **SSO / OAuth2 login** — "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft" using existing MSAL; map to internal user records by email
- [ ] **IP allowlisting** — `FLOWFORGE_ALLOWED_IPS=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.0/24`; reject at `before_request` middleware

### 8.3 Compliance Documentation
- [ ] **Data flow diagram** — which data FlowForge touches (query results, report files, email addresses), where stored, where transmitted
- [ ] **SAML support** — `python3-saml` for Okta / Azure AD / Ping enterprise IdP *(v2.x, lower priority)*

# V3.0 BACKLOG

*No fixed date. Community-driven. Good candidates for "good first issue" labeling.*

## New Connectors & Providers
- [ ] Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift connectors
- [ ] AWS S3 / Azure Blob upload step
- [ ] MSSQL / SQL Server connection support
- [ ] Generic ODBC connection support
- [ ] SendGrid API email provider
- [ ] AWS SES email provider
- [ ] Mailgun email provider
- [ ] Telegram / Slack / Teams notification step

## Pipeline Features
- [ ] Pipeline dependencies — run pipeline B only after pipeline A succeeds
- [ ] Parallel step execution within a single pipeline
- [ ] Pipeline run diff view — row count and output size delta vs last run
- [ ] Report column formatting rules — number format, date format, conditional cell colours in Excel
- [ ] Environment promotion workflow — dev → staging → prod config sync

## Platform
- [ ] Plugin system — community step types loaded from a directory
- [ ] `ff_project_members` join table — team-scoped project access (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Password reset flow via email (deferred from v2)
- [ ] Distributed Redis-backed concurrency lock (replaces per-process semaphore for horizontal scale)

## Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| ~~cx_Oracle requires Oracle Instant Client~~ | ✅ Migrated to `python-oracledb` (thin mode, pure Python) |
| M365 requires Azure AD app registration | Step-by-step guide in `docs/email-providers.md`; `flowforge setup microsoft365` wizard |
| Gmail OAuth2 token expiry | Refresh token handling; re-auth wizard in Settings |
| Drive folder ID opaque to users | Folder picker in frontend fetches Drive tree via API |
| Smart attachment: Drive upload fails after report generated | Fallback: attach directly if Drive upload fails, log warning |
| Large report query times out in Preview | Preview uses `LIMIT 20` wrapper around user query |
| Oracle LOB columns break row serialization | OracleConnection reads LOB values explicitly before cursor close |
| SonarCloud flags security hotspots | Review each hotspot; most will be acknowledged false positives with justification comments |
